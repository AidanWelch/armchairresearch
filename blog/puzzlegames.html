      <p>
            I have seen far to many puzzle games fall for the trap of overcomplicating levels.  This does not
        make them bad games, but it makes bad levels.  You can increase difficulty by increasing complexity, but that
        is not always the best way to increase difficulty.  A clever solution is often far more rewarding than a 
        complicated solution.
      </p>
      <p>
            I decided to make a simple game to illustrate this.  The mouse when in frame draws lines, the mouse can 
            not go over a line.  You must crossover each dot with a line, you must go in order of those which turn green.

          Following now is an example of a level with a simple solution that may not be obvious.
